Upon termination of this Agreement for reasons other than a           relationship with an Excite@Home Named Competitor under Section           16.a.v., the parties will communicate with Program Members as follows:

       i)   Excite@Home will email Program Members on e-centives' behalf up                to a maximum of two times. Consistent with other communications                envisioned during the Term of the Agreement, such mailings will                be branded Excite@Home but will alert Program Members that this                Agreement is to be terminated, the Co-Branded Application will<omitted>continue with e-centives branding, and Program Members will                continue as a participant in the e-centives service unless they                explicitly opt out.  The content and copy of such emails shall be                mutually agreed upon.

       ii)  The first email will be exclusive to e-centives (i.e., it will                not mention similar services from Excite@Home or other third                parties) and will alert Program Members of the continuation of                the e-centives service directly from e-centives. Program Members                shall be further alerted that their membership in the e-centives                service shall continue unless they explicitly opt-out.                Excite@Home shall not promote competing services in such contact                or otherwise discourage Program Members from continuing to use                the e-centives service as provided directly by e-centives.

       iii) The second email will not be exclusive to e-centives. It will                include the same e-centives alerts as in the first email, but may                offer a replacement Excite@Home service and a notification that                the Program Member will remain in such an Excite@Home-provided                service unless they specifically opt-out. Excite@Home shall not                discourage Program Members from continuing to use the e-centives                service directly from e-centives, but may offer an additional                choice. It is conceivable that any one end user customer could                use both services.

       iv)  Any such communications will be subject to Excite@Home's                then-current privacy policy.
Effects of Termination<omitted>iii) For a period of up to sixty (60) days, Application Provider will           provide consulting services to Excite@Home, as Excite@Home may           reasonably request and for reasonable fees to be paid to Application           Provider, such fees to be agreed upon in writing by the Parties, to           assist Excite@Home in providing a seamless transition to Program           Members. Application Provider will have no obligation to provide such           services to Excite@Home to the extent that Application Provider's           personnel and resources are unavailable in the amounts requested by           Excite@Home or if the Parties are unable in good faith to agree on the           reasonable fees to be paid to Application Provider for such services.           Application Provider will not be required, in the course of providing           such consulting services to Excite@Home, to disclose or transfer to           Excite@Home any proprietary information, software, or Intellectual           Property of Application Provider or any of its merchant partners.
To further ensure a seamless transition for Program Members, in the           event of a termination based upon a material breach by e-centives or           an acquisition pursuant to Section 16.a.v. only, Application Provider           shall continue to host and maintain the Co-Branded Application for a           period of one hundred twenty (120) days following either receipt or           issuance of notice of intention to terminate this Agreement.
