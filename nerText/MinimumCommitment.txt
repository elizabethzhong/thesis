Licensor may terminate this Agreement:

    (1)   Upon ninety (90) days prior written notice if Licensee does not enter            into Sublicenses and other agreements relating to the Licensed            Products with Redistributors and Customers that result in fees payable           to Licensor hereunder in an aggregate amount equal to or greater than            the Quota Amount for any year during the term hereof.  As used herein,           the term "Quota Amount" means $50,000 for each of the first and second           years of the original term of this Agreement and an amount agreed to            in writing by the parties hereto in respect of any subsequent one year           renewal term (provided that such amount equals or exceeds $50,000).             If Licensor fails to deliver notice of termination pursuant to this            subsection 14.2(b)(1) within six (6) months after the end of the term           to which such termination relates, Licensor will be deemed to have            waived such termination right in respect of such term (but not in            respect of subsequent terms);
The Professional agrees to participate in a minimum of five (5) other events per calendar year to market and promote the Company's products,





including but not limited to market consultations, each of which shall include meeting with the Company executives to assist in the design, development, marketing and promotion of the Company's products.
